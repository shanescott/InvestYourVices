Invest your vices helps users see the impact of their daily spending habits.
We tend to overspend on things like coffee, beer and fast food. What if we saved that money? Better yet,
what if we invested that money? 

Choose a vice, Choose a stock option, and see how much money you're missing out on by grabbing that coffee every morning.
